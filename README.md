## Key Features  

### 1. **Multi-Page Interface**  
The app is structured into four main sections:  
- **Home**: General chatbot focused on Uzbekistanâ€™s social, economic, and political aspects (excluding historical topics).  
- **Historical Sites**: Information about historical monuments in Uzbekistan.  
- **Historical Figures**: Insights about historical figures and great scholars from Uzbekistan.  
- **Travel Start**: Travel services, maps, and location-based assistance.  

### 2. **Dynamic Chatbot Functionality**  
Each section has its own chatbot with tailored knowledge and a specific scope. For example:  
- **Home Chatbot**: Focuses on Uzbekistanâ€™s general topics, excluding historical figures or sites.

### 3. **Interactive Map**  
The **Travel Start** page integrates a Folium-based map where users can select a location. The chatbot then tailors travel guidance based on the chosen coordinates.  

### 4. **Session Management**  
The app stores session data such as chat history, selected services, and user inputs. Each chatbot's conversation history is preserved independently.
